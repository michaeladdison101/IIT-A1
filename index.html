					<h1>Personal Information</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Business Information Systems through Open Universities Australia (OUA).</p> 
					<p>Live with my wife and two young boys in Melbourne's inner northwest. Since finishing high school (VCE) in 2003, I have completed a Certificate IV in Information Technology (Networking), Diploma of Information Technology, plus university study in Information Systems.</p>
					<p>I have worked in various roles in IT for approximately 13 years. These roles have ranged from IT Support through to Project Management. Besides speaking English, I have a working knowledge of HTML, PowerShell, and SQL, as these have been often used in previous employment.</p>
					<p>Outside of work, study, and family commitments, I enjoy using my road bicycle to keep fit and explore different parts of Melbourne and its surroundings.</p>

					<h1>Interest in IT</h1>
				</div>
				
				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>My current interest in IT revolves around working as a Technical Writer at an Australian-headquartered cyber safety company servicing the education and consumer sectors in Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. My interest in IT goes back to 2001 when I began some programming study in high school and learned how to build a new computer for the family.</p>
					<p>I began my first permanent IT role as an IT Support Technician at the beginning of 2010. I stayed at this employer for nearly nine years, with the role morphing to include system, network, and database administration duties. During 2018 I changed employers and worked as a Digital Producer for nearly one year. Work duties primarily involved being an intermediary between developers and customer stakeholders. My current position has transitioned from service delivery to technical writing, which assists our support teams and customers.</p>
					<p>I chose to study at RMIT University as they offered IT elective subjects which complement and fit my schedule to finalise my Business Information Systems degree. My learning expectations at RMIT are to revisit core IT and programming theory in Introduction to Information Technology and Introduction to Programming.</p>

				<h1>Project Idea</h1>
			</div>
			
			<div class="sectionContent">
				<article>
					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<p>The project idea is the creation of a progressive web app (PWA) that provides dog owners with quick information and reviews of rest stops along Victorian roads. </p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Motivation</h2>
					<p>The motivation behind the project came about when the car I was driving broke down at a rest stop on the side of a highway. A couple who stopped at the rest stop before our break down was traveling with a large dog and it was clear the rest stop didn't have anywhere to let the dog stretches its legs or obtain safe drinking water. I wondered if a Google Search of the rest area indicates the facilities available to dog owners. To my surprise, this information wasn't available. This project would be helpful for dog owners to plan their travels to best accommodate their pets and may help to improve the facilities available at roadside rest areas through awareness by local councils and businesses.</p>
				</article>
				
				<article>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>The features of the PWA would include a list and map that shows rest stops located in Victoria. Each rest stop would have its own page, including its location, photos, bathroom facilities for dog owners, availability of safe drinking water, availability of secure areas for a dog to walk or run, additional notes based on user feedback and a rating of the dog-friendliness of the rest stop.</p>
					<p>Future enhancements may include a map that uses the device's GPS location to show nearby rest stops. The ability for users to add photos and reviews. Integration with a service similar to Snap Send Solve to allow users to report maintenance issues to local councils and businesses.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
					<p>Software needed for the project would include a no-code PWA builder such as Appy Pie or Jotform App. To publish the PWA to the Apple or Google app stores, developer accounts will need to be created for both stores.</p>
					<p>Internet access and email are required to develop and publish the PWA and communicate with stakeholders. A photo and code editor are likely needed to manipulate content produced or sent in via stakeholders.</p>
					<p>Hardware required would include a laptop or desktop computer, mobile phone and tablet to develop and test the PWA.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Skills Required</h2>
					<p>Skills required for the project include being proficient in the use and publishing a PWA using the chosen PWA builder software. Working knowledge of photo editing software and modern computer and mobile operating systems. These skills can be easily be obtained by following numerous online tutorials on platforms such as Codecademy, Udemy and YouTube.</p>
				</article>

				<article>
					<h2>Outcome</h2>
					<p>The project's success will lead to an online resource that makes car travel for dog owners easier. Dog owners will be able to plan their trip to utilise better rest stops that are more suited to pets. Hopefully, the project will bring improvements to the rest stop facilities available by informing local councils and businesses of potential areas that need attention.</p>
